This github account was created so I can post my projects and keep track of my code. 
This repository was created for my CTI-110 class to put in projects we will do throughout the semester
I Launched the GitHub Desktop application on my computer. In GitHub Desktop, I navigated to the "File" menu and selected "Clone Repository". In the "Clone a Repository" window, I had a list of my GitHub repositories. I chose this repository to clone. After selecting the repository, I chose where to clone it on my local machine. Once I selected the repository and chosen a location, I clicked the "Clone" button.
